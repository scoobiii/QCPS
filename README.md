### Incident: DeepMind's Cost Reduction and Failures in Climate Models

In July 2022, the decision to increase the reference temperature to 27°C (80°F) in some data centers, driven by recommendations from ASHRAE and the European community, contributed to the failure of several Google data centers. This initiative was based on the assumption that higher temperatures would save energy. However, this decision led to unforeseen consequences, highlighting flaws not only in climate models but also in cooling predictions and temperature control systems.

### Failure of Climate Models and Extreme Predictions

Recently, the UK recorded 40°C for the first time in London, an unexpected climatic milestone. This anomaly reflects the shortcomings of current climate models, which fail to adequately account for extreme variables and uncertainties associated with long-term predictions. Climate models, often based on historical average trends, underestimate rapid changes and extreme temperature fluctuations, as observed in several high-intensity weather events.

---

### Impact on Cooling System Design

The lack of safety margins in cooling systems, designed with a focus on low cost at the expense of energy efficiency and safety, proved catastrophic. The temperature increase was faster and more intense than expected, forcing cooling systems to operate beyond their ideal capacities. DeepMind's strategy, which aimed for a 40% reduction in cooling costs, failed to consider the need for system resilience in extreme scenarios, resulting in operational failures and significant data losses.

### Application of Fluid Mechanics and Physical Analysis

Fluid mechanics applied to data center cooling systems can help understand inefficiencies. Airflow and thermal behavior in cooling systems were not adequately modeled to support temperatures higher than recommended. By increasing temperatures, the behavior of the coolant (usually air or liquids like water and glycol) in cooling units became unpredictable. The heat exchange rate was compromised, leading to increased internal server temperatures. The thermodynamics involved, including heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation, were underestimated, resulting in failures due to inadequate heat dissipation at elevated temperatures.

### Redesign of Climate Prediction and Energy Management Systems

Given the identified failures, it is crucial to redesign climate prediction and energy management systems. A new climate prediction and temperature control system must be more resilient and adaptable, using more robust approaches that integrate not only average climate conditions but also extreme and short-term variations.

---

### Integrated Climate Prediction System:

1. **Dynamic Temperature Modeling**: Using machine learning-based prediction models that can effectively incorporate extreme climate variations and unforeseen events, taking into account the variability of climate behavior.

2. **Energy Management and Quantum Core Temperature Control**: Temperature management must be able to accurately monitor all physical and virtual server cores. The use of quantum core technologies to predict and control energy flow in cooling networks can offer an efficient solution. Quantum physics can be applied to model the thermal behavior of components in high-performance systems, enabling real-time optimization of cooling systems.

3. **Treemap Monitoring of Physical and Virtual Cores**: An efficient monitoring system for all physical and virtual server cores must be implemented. It is essential to develop technologies that overcome the limitations of drivers in virtual machines (VMs), which hinder accurate temperature monitoring in virtual cores. The **Treemap** can be an interactive visual solution to map and control temperatures and energy efficiency in server systems.

### Conclusion

The attempt to reduce costs by increasing temperatures in data centers, without a deeper analysis of climate models and safety margins in cooling systems, was a strategic mistake. The failure of climate models to predict extremes like 40°C in London and the lack of resilience in cooling systems, designed with a focus on low cost and without robust consideration of operational and climatic variables, resulted in severe operational failures. A redesign of climate prediction and temperature control systems, including an integrated approach to energy and temperature management, is essential to ensure the safety and operational efficiency of data centers in the future.

## Project Description

This project aims to use classical and quantum simulators to predict future temperatures in London (for July 19, 20, 22, and 24, 2021 and 2022) based on historical temperature data from 1940 to 2020. The predictions also include the temperature of Google's data center cores in London, combining machine learning algorithms and quantum simulation techniques. The goal is to improve climate forecasting and optimize energy usage in data center cooling systems.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Historical temperature data for London from 1940 to 2020 will be used to train the models.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalization of the data.
3. **Quantum Simulation**: Implementation of a quantum simulator to predict temperature variations based on historical data.
4. **Classical Simulation**: Use of classical machine learning models to compare prediction accuracy.
5. **Prediction**: Temperature predictions for specific dates (July 19, 20, 22, and 24, 2021 and 2022) and predictions for the temperature of Google's data center cores in London.
