**Title: Climate Resilience in Data Centers: An Analysis of the Google Cloud Case in London**

**Abstract**  
The incident at the Google Cloud data center in London on July 19, 2022, during the UK's hottest day on record, exposed critical vulnerabilities in the climate resilience of cloud computing infrastructures. This article analyzes the causes of the problem, related to cooling system failure, and discusses the need to improve monitoring and management of internal and external temperatures in data centers. Additionally, it proposes the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for predicting and regressing critical temperatures to enhance climate resilience and prevent future incidents. The article also explores emerging liquid cooling technologies and their impact on energy efficiency.

**1. Introduction**  
Data centers are critical infrastructures for the digital economy, but their operation is highly dependent on controlled environmental conditions. The incident at the Google Cloud data center in London, which occurred during an extreme heatwave, highlighted the fragility of these systems in the face of climate externalities. This article explores the causes of the problem, the failures in temperature management, and proposes AI-based solutions to mitigate future risks.

---

**2. The Google Cloud Incident in London**  
On July 19, 2022, the UK recorded unprecedented temperatures, exceeding 40°C (104°F). On the same day, the Google Cloud data center in London experienced a cooling system failure, described as "cooling-related." The failure began at 1:13 PM ET (6:13 PM BST) and impacted a "small subset" of customers. The incident revealed a lack of regional redundancy and the inability to adequately monitor the temperatures of virtual machine (VM) cores and physical servers.

---

**3. Vulnerabilities in Cooling Architecture**  
External temperature is an externality that directly affects the physical layer of computing architecture. In the case of Google Cloud, the cooling system failure was exacerbated by the absence of continuous monitoring of VM core and physical server temperatures. The lack of I2C sensors or equivalents to collect real-time temperature data prevents a rapid response to critical conditions.

Additionally, the elevation of temperature set points in data centers from 25°C to 27°C, recommended by ASHRAE and adopted by the European community to reduce costs, proved inadequate. The measure was reversed, and a new temperature category (22°C) was established for high-density servers, which now use direct liquid cooling on CPUs and motherboards, a practice revived from old mainframes and standardized by Nvidia.

---

**4. Proposed AI-Based Solutions**  
To enhance climate resilience in data centers, the adoption of AI techniques for monitoring and predicting critical temperatures is proposed. The approaches include:

1. **Prediction**: Use of AI models to predict when temperatures will reach critical levels, enabling preventive actions.
2. **Simple Regression**: Analysis of historical data to identify patterns and anticipate cooling system failures.
3. **Safety Margin Testing**: Conduct tests to determine the response time of cooling systems when reducing the set point by 1°C, 2°C, or 3°C.
4. **Automation**: Implementation of automated systems to dynamically adjust temperature based on predictions and real-time conditions.

---

**5. Emerging Cooling Technologies**  
Direct liquid cooling on CPUs and motherboards is an emerging technology that promises greater thermal efficiency. Companies like Nvidia have already adopted this practice, which allows for more efficient heat dissipation than traditional air cooling methods. Additionally, the use of non-conductive dielectric liquids is gaining popularity, as it eliminates the risk of short circuits and increases component lifespan.

---

**6. Environmental Impact and Energy Efficiency**  
Data centers are major energy consumers and heat generators. The low energy efficiency of CPUs, TPUs, GPUs, and QPUs contributes to global warming. To combat this issue, it is essential to look not only at climate externalities but also at internal temperature management and energy efficiency. The adoption of liquid cooling technologies and the optimization of cooling systems are important steps to reduce environmental impact.

---

**7. Conclusion**  
The incident at the Google Cloud data center in London highlighted the need for greater climate resilience in cloud computing infrastructures. The lack of adequate monitoring and reliance on traditional cooling systems make these systems vulnerable to extreme climate conditions. The adoption of AI techniques for predicting and regressing critical temperatures, combined with the automation of cooling systems, can enhance resilience and prevent future incidents. Additionally, it is crucial to rethink the energy efficiency and environmental impact of data centers to combat global warming.
